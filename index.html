      <h1>Shikantaza</h1>
      <p>Shikantaza (<span lang="ja">只管打坐</span>) is Dogen's Japanese translation of the Chinese phrase <em>zhǐguǎn dǎzuò</em> (<span lang="zh_CN">只管打坐</span> / <span lang="zh_HK">祇管打坐</span>), "focus on meditative practice alone", although many modern Western practitioners have interpreted this very differently. The phrase was used by Dogen's teacher Rujing, a monk of the Caodong school of Chan Buddhism, to refer to the meditation-practice called "silent illumination" (Chinese: <span lang="zh_CN">默照禅</span>), or "serene reflection", taught by the Caodong master Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157). In Japan, it is associated with the Zen Soto school, Dogen's offshoot of Caodong. Some practitioners teach that shikantaza means that one should not focus attention on a specific object (such as the breath), instead "just sitting" in a state of conscious awareness; however, the 13th-century origin of the expression indicates a general emphasis on meditation in any form as sufficient for spiritual enlightenment. The original teaching was meant to criticize the complicated ceremony, abstruse study, endless tracing of spiritual lineage, and other aspects of Buddhism that even by the 12th century had been identified as excessive.</p>
